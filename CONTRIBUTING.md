# Contributing to RTD

We welcome contributions from engineers, neuroscientists, and AI researchers to push the boundaries of autonomous surgery.

## How to Contribute
1. **Algorithm Refinement**: Propose optimizations for the Recursive State-Space Estimation or Eigenvalue Decay parameters.
2. **Simulation**: Run RTD models against high-entropy datasets (biological pulsations, tissue impedance variability).
3. **Hardware Adaptation**: Suggest implementations for specific robotic actuators or LPU (Language Processing Unit) architectures.

## Standards
* Ensure all mathematical models maintain the **Static Core** invariant.
* Focus on deterministic convergence over stochastic "guessing."
* Prioritize safety-critical fail-safes (Null-Prediction error handling).

Join us in making interstellar surgery a reality.
